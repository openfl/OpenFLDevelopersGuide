# Chapter 31: Mouse input {#chapter-31-mouse-input}

Your application can create interactivity by capturing and responding to mouse input. Note that this section assumes that you are already familiar with the Haxe event model. For more information, see

"Handling events" on

page 125

.

For information on discovering what kind of mouse support is available (such as persistent cursor, stylus or touch input) during runtime, see

"Discovering input types" on page 558

**Capturing mouse input**

Mouse clicks create mouse events that can be used to trigger interactive functionality. You can add an event listener to the Stage to listen for mouse events that occur anywhere within the project. You can also add event listeners to objects on the Stage that inherit from InteractiveObject (for example, Sprite or MovieClip); these listeners are triggered when the object is clicked.

As with keyboard events, mouse events bubble. In the following example, because square is a child of the Stage, the event dispatches both from the sprite square as well as from the Stage object when the square is clicked:

var square:Sprite = new Sprite(); square.graphics.beginFill(0xFF0000); square.graphics.drawRect(0,0,100,100); square.graphics.endFill(); square.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, reportClick); square.x =

square.y = 50; addChild(square);

stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, reportClick); function reportClick(event:MouseEvent):void

{

trace(event.currentTarget.toString() + " dispatches MouseEvent. Local coords [" + event.localX + "," + event.localY + "] Stage coords [" + event.stageX + "," + event.stageY + "]");

}

In the previous example, notice that the mouse event contains positional information about the click. The localX and localY properties contain the location of the click on the lowest child in the display chain. For example, clicking at the top-left corner of square reports local coordinates of [0,0] because that is the registration point of square.

Alternatively, the stageX and stageY properties refer to the global coordinates of the click on the Stage. The same click reports [50,50] for these coordinates, because square was moved to these coordinates. Both of these coordinate pairs can be useful depending on how you want to respond to user interaction.

**_Note:_** _In full-screen mode, you can configure the application to use mouse locking. Mouse locking disables the cursor and enables unbounded mouse movement. For more information, see_

_"Working with full-screen mode" on page 167_

_._

The MouseEvent object also contains altKey, ctrlKey, and shiftKey Boolean properties. You can use these properties to check if the Alt, Ctrl, or Shift key is also being pressed at the time of the mouse click.

**Dragging Sprites around the stage**

You can allow users to drag a Sprite object around the stage using the startDrag() method of the Sprite class. The following code shows an example of this:

import openfl.display.Sprite;
import openfl.events.MouseEvent;

var circle:Sprite = new Sprite();
circle.graphics.beginFill(0xFFCC00);
circle.graphics.drawCircle(0, 0, 40);

var target1:Sprite = new Sprite();
target1.graphics.beginFill(0xCCFF00);
target1.graphics.drawRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
target1.name = "target1";

var target2:Sprite = new Sprite();
target2.graphics.beginFill(0xCCFF00);
target2.graphics.drawRect(0, 200, 100, 100);
target2.name = "target2";

addChild(target1);
addChild(target2);
addChild(circle);

circle.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, mouseDown);
function mouseDown(event:MouseEvent):void

{

circle.startDrag();

}

circle.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, mouseReleased);

function mouseReleased(event:MouseEvent):void

{

circle.stopDrag(); trace(circle.dropTarget.name);

}

Drag-and-drop in AIR

In Adobe AIR, you can enable drag-and-drop support to allow users to drag data into and out of your application. For more details, see

"Drag and drop in AIR" on page 608

## Customizing the mouse cursor {#customizing-the-mouse-cursor}

The mouse cursor (mouse pointer) can be hidden or swapped for any display object on the Stage. To hide the mouse cursor, call the Mouse.hide() method. Customize the cursor by calling Mouse.hide(), listening to the Stage for the MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE event, and setting the coordinates of a display object (your custom cursor) to the stageX and stageY properties of the event. The following example illustrates a basic execution of this task:

var cursor:Sprite = new Sprite(); cursor.graphics.beginFill(0x000000); cursor.graphics.drawCircle(0,0,20); cursor.graphics.endFill(); addChild(cursor);

stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE,redrawCursor); Mouse.hide();

function redrawCursor(event:MouseEvent):void

{

cursor.x = event.stageX; cursor.y = event.stageY;

}
