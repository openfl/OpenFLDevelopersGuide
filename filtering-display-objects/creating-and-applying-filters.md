# Creating and applying filters {#creating-and-applying-filters}

Filters allow you to apply a range of effects to bitmap and display objects, ranging from drop shadows to bevels and blurs. Each filter is defined as a class, so applying filters involves creating instances of filter objects, which is no different from constructing any other object. Once you’ve created an instance of a filter object, it can easily be applied to a display object by using the object’s filters property, or in the case of a BitmapData object, by using the applyFilter() method.

**Creating a filter**

To create a filter object, simply call the constructor method of your selected filter class. For example, to create a DropShadowFilter object, use the following code:

import openfl.filters.DropShadowFilter;

var myFilter:DropShadowFilter = new DropShadowFilter();

Although not shown here, the DropShadowFilter() constructor (like all the filter classes’ constructors) accepts several optional parameters that can be used to customize the appearance of the filter effect.

## Applying a filter {#applying-a-filter}

Once you&#039;ve constructed a filter object, you can apply it to a display object or a BitmapData object; how you apply the filter depends on the object to which you’re applying it.

Applying a filter to a display object

When you apply filter effects to a display object, you apply them through the filters property. The filters property of a display object is an Array instance, whose elements are the filter objects applied to the display object. To apply a single filter to a display object, create the filter instance, add it to an Array instance, and assign that Array object to the display object’s filters property:

import openfl.display.Bitmap; import openfl.display.BitmapData;

import openfl.filters.DropShadowFilter;

// Create a bitmapData object and render it to screen

var myBitmapData:BitmapData = new BitmapData(100,100,false,0xFFFF3300); var myDisplayObject:Bitmap = new Bitmap(myBitmapData); addChild(myDisplayObject);

// Create a DropShadowFilter instance.

var dropShadow:DropShadowFilter = new DropShadowFilter();

// Create the filters array, adding the filter to the array by passing it as

// a parameter to the Array() constructor.

var filtersArray:Array = new Array(dropShadow);

// Assign the filters array to the display object to apply the filter. myDisplayObject.filters = filtersArray;

If you want to assign multiple filters to the object, simply add all the filters to the Array instance before assigning it to the filters property. You can add multiple objects to an Array by passing them as parameters to its constructor. For example, this code applies a bevel filter and a glow filter to the previously created display object:

import openfl.filters.BevelFilter; import openfl.filters.GlowFilter;

// Create the filters and add them to an array. var bevel:BevelFilter = new BevelFilter();

var glow:GlowFilter = new GlowFilter();

var filtersArray:Array = new Array(bevel, glow);

// Assign the filters array to the display object to apply the filter. myDisplayObject.filters = filtersArray;

When you’re creating the array containing the filters, you can create it using the new Array() constructor (as shown in the previous examples) or you can use Array literal syntax, wrapping the filters in square brackets ([]). For instance, this line of code:

var filters:Array = new Array(dropShadow, blur);

does the same thing as this line of code:

var filters:Array = [dropShadow, blur];

If you apply multiple filters to display objects, they are applied in a cumulative, sequential manner. For example, if a filters array has two elements, a bevel filter added first and a drop shadow filter added second, the drop shadow filter is applied to both the bevel filter and the display object. This is because of the drop shadow filter’s second position in the filters array. If you want to apply filters in a noncumulative manner, apply each filter to a new copy of the display object.

If you’re only assigning one or a few filters to a display object, you can create the filter instance and assign it to the object in a single statement. For example, the following line of code applies a blur filter to a display object called myDisplayObject:

myDisplayObject.filters = [new BlurFilter()];

The previous code creates an Array instance using Array literal syntax (square braces), creates a BlurFilter instance as an element in the Array, and assigns that Array to the filters property of the display object named myDisplayObject.

Removing filters from a display object

Removing all filters from a display object is as simple as assigning a null value to the filters property:

myDisplayObject.filters = null;

If you’ve applied multiple filters to an object and want to remove only one of the filters, you must go through several steps to change the filters property array. For more information, see

"Potential issues for working with filters" on

page 270

.

Applying a filter to a BitmapData object

Applying a filter to a BitmapData object requires the use of the BitmapData object’s applyFilter() method:

var rect:Rectangle = new Rectangle(); var origin:Point = new Point();

myBitmapData.applyFilter(sourceBitmapData, rect, origin, new BlurFilter());

The applyFilter() method applies a filter to a source BitmapData object, producing a new, filtered image. This method does not modify the original source image; instead, the result of the filter being applied to the source image is stored in the BitmapData instance on which the applyFilter() method is called.

## How filters work {#how-filters-work}

Display object filtering works by caching a copy of the original object as a transparent bitmap.

Once a filter has been applied to a display object, the runtime caches the object as a bitmap for as long as the object has a valid filter list. This source bitmap is then used as the original image for all subsequently applied filter effects.

Each display object usually contains two bitmaps: one with the original unfiltered source display object and another for the final image after filtering. The final image is used when rendering. As long as the display object does not change, the final image does not need updating.

## Potential issues for working with filters {#potential-issues-for-working-with-filters}

There are several potential sources of confusion or trouble to keep in mind when you’re working with filters.

Filters and bitmap caching

To apply a filter to a display object, bitmap caching must be enabled for that object. When you apply a filter to a display object whose cacheAsBitmap property is set to false, the object’s cacheAsBitmap property is automatically set to true. If you later remove all the filters from the display object, the cacheAsBitmap property is reset to the last value it was set to.

Changing filters at run time

If a display object already has one or more filters applied to it, you can’t change the set of filters by adding additional filters to or removing filters from the filters property array. Instead, to add to or change the set of filters being applied, you must make your changes to a separate array, then assign that array to the filters property of the display object for the filters to be applied to the object. The simplest way to do this is to read the filters property array into an Array variable and make your modifications to this temporary array. You then reassign this array back to the filters property of the display object. In more complex cases, you might need to keep a separate master array of filters. You make any changes to that master filter array, and reassign the master array to the display object’s filters property after each change.

Adding an additional filter

The following code demonstrates the process of adding an additional filter to a display object that already has one or more filters applied to it. Initially, a glow filter is applied to the display object named myDisplayObject; later, when the display object is clicked, the addFilters() function is called. In this function, two additional filters are applied to myDisplayObject:

import openfl.events.MouseEvent; import openfl.filters.*;

myDisplayObject.filters = [new GlowFilter()]; function addFilters(event:MouseEvent):void

{

// Make a copy of the filters array.

var filtersCopy:Array = myDisplayObject.filters;

// Make desired changes to the filters (in this case, adding filters). filtersCopy.push(new BlurFilter());

filtersCopy.push(new DropShadowFilter());

// Apply the changes by reassigning the array to the filters property. myDisplayObject.filters = filtersCopy;

}

myDisplayObject.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, addFilters);

Removing one filter from a set of filters

If a display object has multiple filters applied to it, and you want to remove one of the filters while the other filters continue to be applied to the object, you copy the filters into a temporary array, remove the unwanted filter from that array, and reassign the temporary array to the display object’s filters property. Several ways to remove one or more elements from any array are described in

"Retrieving values and removing array elements" on page 31

.

The most straightforward situation is to remove the top-most filter on the object (the last filter applied to the object). You use the Array class’s pop() method to remove the filter from the array:

// Example of removing the top-most filter from a display object

// named &quot;filteredObject&quot;.

var tempFilters:Array = filteredObject.filters;

// Remove the last element from the Array (the top-most filter). tempFilters.pop();

// Apply the new set of filters to the display object. filteredObject.filters = tempFilters;

Similarly, to remove the bottom-most filter (the first one applied to the object) you use the same code, substituting the Array class’s shift() method in place of the pop() method.

To remove a filter from the middle of an array of filters (assuming that the array has more than two filters) you can use the splice() method. You must know the index (the position in the array) of the filter you want to remove. For example, the following code removes the second filter (the filter at index 1) from a display object:

// Example of removing a filter from the middle of a stack of filters

// applied to a display object named &quot;filteredObject&quot;. var tempFilters:Array = filteredObject.filters;

// Remove the second filter from the array. It&#039;s the item at index 1

// because Array indexes start from 0.

// The first &quot;1&quot; indicates the index of the filter to remove; the

// second &quot;1&quot; indicates how many elements to remove. tempFilters.splice(1, 1);

// Apply the new set of filters to the display object. filteredObject.filters = tempFilters;

Determining a filter’s index

You need to know which filter to remove from the array, so that you know the index of the filter. You must either know (by virtue of the way the application is designed), or calculate the index of the filter to remove.

The best approach is to design your application so that the filter you want to remove is always in the same position in the set of filters. For example, if you have a single display object with a convolution filter and a drop-shadow filter applied to it (in that order), and you want to remove the drop-shadow filter but keep the convolution filter, the filter is in a known position (the top-most filter) so that you can know ahead of time which Array method to use (in this case Array.pop() to remove the drop-shadow filter).

If the filter you want to remove is always a certain type, but not necessarily always in the same position in the set of filters, you can check the data type of each filter in the array to determine which one to remove. For example, the following code determines which of a set of filters is a glow filter, and removes that filter from the set.

// Example of removing a glow filter from a set of filters, where the

//filter you want to remove is the only GlowFilter instance applied

// to the filtered object.

var tempFilters:Array = filteredObject.filters;

// Loop through the filters to find the index of the GlowFilter instance. var glowIndex:int;

var numFilters:int = tempFilters.length; for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; numFilters; i++)

{

if (tempFilters[i] is GlowFilter)

{

glowIndex = i; break;

}

}

// Remove the glow filter from the array. tempFilters.splice(glowIndex, 1);

// Apply the new set of filters to the display object. filteredObject.filters = tempFilters;

In a more complex case, such as if the filter to remove is selected at runtime, the best approach is to keep a separate, persistent copy of the filter array that serves as the master list of filters. Any time you make a change to the set of filters, change the master list then apply that filter array as the filters property of the display object.

For example, in the following code listing, multiple convolution filters are applied to a display object to create different visual effects, and at a later point in the application one of those filters is removed while the others are retained. In this case, the code keeps a master copy of the filters array, as well as a reference to the filter to remove. Finding and removing the specific filter is similar to the preceding approach, except that instead of making a temporary copy of the filters array, the master copy is manipulated and then applied to the display object.

// Example of removing a filter from a set of

// filters, where there may be more than one

// of that type of filter applied to the filtered

// object, and you only want to remove one.

// A master list of filters is stored in a separate,

// persistent Array variable. var masterFilterList:Array;

// At some point, you store a reference to the filter you

// want to remove.

var filterToRemove:ConvolutionFilter;

// ... assume the filters have been added to masterFilterList,

// which is then assigned as the filteredObject.filters: filteredObject.filters = masterFilterList;

// ... later, when it&#039;s time to remove the filter, this code gets called:

// Loop through the filters to find the index of masterFilterList. var removeIndex:int = -1;

var numFilters:int = masterFilterList.length; for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; numFilters; i++)

{

if (masterFilterList[i] == filterToRemove)

{

removeIndex = i; break;

}

}

if (removeIndex &gt;= 0)

{

// Remove the filter from the array. masterFilterList.splice(removeIndex, 1);

// Apply the new set of filters to the display object. filteredObject.filters = masterFilterList;

}

In this approach (when you’re comparing a stored filter reference to the items in the filters array to determine which filter to remove), you _must_ keep a separate copy of the filters array—the code does not work if you compare the stored filter reference to the elements in a temporary array copied from the display object’s filters property. This is because internally, when you assign an array to the filters property, the runtime makes a copy of each filter object in the array. Those copies (rather than the original objects) are applied to the display object, and when you read the filters property into a temporary array, the temporary array contains references to the copied filter objects rather than references to the original filter objects. Consequently, if in the preceding example you try to determine the index of filterToRemove by comparing it to the filters in a temporary filters array, no match is found.

Filters and object transformations

No filtered region—a drop shadow, for example—outside of a display object’s bounding box rectangle is considered to be part of the surface for the purposes of hit detection (determining if an instance overlaps or intersects with another instance). Because the DisplayObject class’s hit detection methods are vector-based, you cannot perform a hit detection on the bitmap result. For example, if you apply a bevel filter to a button instance, hit detection is not available on the beveled portion of the instance.

Scaling, rotating, and skewing are not supported by filters; if the filtered display object itself is scaled (if scaleX and scaleY are not 100%), the filter effect does not scale with the instance. This means that the original shape of the instance rotates, scales, or skews; however, the filter does not rotate, scale, or skew with the instance.

You can animate an instance with a filter to create realistic effects, or nest instances and use the BitmapData class to animate filters to achieve this effect.

Filters and Bitmap objects

When you apply any filter to a BitmapData object, the cacheAsBitmap property is automatically set to true. In this way, the filter is actually applied to the copy of the object rather than to the original.

This copy is then placed on the main display (over the original object) as close as possible to the nearest pixel. If the bounds of the original bitmap change, the filtered copy bitmap is recreated from the original, rather than being stretched or distorted.

If you clear all filters for a display object, the cacheAsBitmap property is reset to what it was before the filter was applied.
