# Copying bitmap data {#copying-bitmap-data}

To copy bitmap data from one image to another, you can use several methods: `clone()`, `copyPixels()`, `copyChannel()`, `draw()`, and `drawWithQuality()`.

As its name suggests, the `clone()` method lets you clone, or sample, bitmap data from one BitmapData object to another. When called, the method returns a new BitmapData object that is an exact clone of the original instance it was copied from.

The following example clones a copy of an orange (parent) square and places the clone beside the original parent square:

```haxe
import openfl.display.Bitmap;
import openfl.display.BitmapData;

...

var myParentSquareBitmap = new BitmapData (100, 100, false, 0x00ff3300);
var myClonedChild = myParentSquareBitmap.clone ();

var myParentSquareContainer = new Bitmap (myParentSquareBitmap);
this.addChild (myParentSquareContainer);

var myClonedChildContainer = new Bitmap (myClonedChild);
this.addChild (myClonedChildContainer);
myClonedChildContainer.x = 110;
```

The `copyPixels()` method is a quick and easy way of copying pixels from one BitmapData object to another. The method takes a rectangular snapshot (defined by the `sourceRect` parameter) of the source image and copies it to another rectangular area (of equal size). The location of the newly "pasted" rectangle is defined within the `destPoint` parameter.

The `copyChannel()` method samples a predefined color channel value (alpha, red, green, or blue) from a source BitmapData object and copies it into a channel of a destination BitmapData object. Calling this method does not affect the other channels in the destination BitmapData object.

The `draw()` and `drawWithQuality()` methods draw, or render, the graphical content from a source sprite, movie clip, or other display object on to a new bitmap. Using the matrix, colorTransform, blendMode, and destination clipRect parameters, you can modify the way in which the new bitmap is rendered. This method uses the vector renderer in OpenFL to generate the data.

When you call `draw()` or `drawWithQuality()`, you pass the source object (sprite, movie clip, or other display object) as the first parameter, as demonstrated here:

```haxe
myBitmap.draw (movieClip);
```

If the source object has had any transformations (color, matrix, and so forth) applied to it after it was originally loaded, these transformations are not copied across to the new object. If you want to copy the transformations to the new bitmap, then you need to copy the value of the `transform` property from the original object to the `transform` property of the Bitmap object that uses the new BitmapData object.
