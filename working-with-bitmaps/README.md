# Chapter 5: Working with bitmaps {#chapter-5-working-with-bitmaps}

In addition to its vector drawing capabilities, OpenFL includes the ability to create bitmap images or manipulate the pixel data of external bitmap images that are loaded into a SWF. With the ability to access and change individual pixel values, you can create your own filter-like image effects and use the built-in noise functions to create textures and random noise.
