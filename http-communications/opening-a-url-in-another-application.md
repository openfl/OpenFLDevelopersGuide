# Opening a URL in another application {#opening-a-url-in-another-application}

You can use the navigateToURL() function to open a URL in a web browser or other application. For content running in AIR, the navigateToURL() function opens the page in the default system web browser.

For the URLRequest object you pass as the request parameter of this function, only the url property is used.

The first parameter of the navigateToURL() function, the navigate parameter, is a URLRequest object (see

“Using

the URLRequest class” on page 811

). The second is an optional window parameter, in which you can specify the window name. For example, the following code opens the [www.adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com/) web page:

var url:String = [&quot;http://www.adobe.com&quot;;](http://www.adobe.com/)

var urlReq:URLRequest = new URLRequest(url); navigateToURL(urlReq);

**_Note:_** _When using the navigateToURL() function, the runtime treats a URLRequest object that uses the POST method (one that has its method property set to URLRequestMethod.POST) as using the GET method._

When using the navigateToURL() function, URI schemes are permitted based on the security sandbox of the code calling the navigateToURL() function.

Some APIs allow you to launch content in a web browser. For security reasons, some URI schemes are prohibited when using these APIs in AIR. The list of prohibited schemes depends on the security sandbox of the code using the API. (For details on security sandboxes, see

“AIR security” on page 1076

.)

Application sandbox (AIR only)

Any URI scheme can be used in URL launched by content running in the AIR application sandbox. An application must be registered to handle the URI scheme or the request does nothing. The following schemes are supported on many computers and devices:

*   http:
*   https:
*   file:
*   mailto: — AIR directs these requests to the registered system mail application
*   sms: — AIR directs sms: requests to the default text message app. The URL format must conform to the system conventions under which the app is running. For example, on Android, the URI scheme must be lowercase.

navigateToURL( new URLRequest( &quot;sms:+15555550101&quot;) );

*   tel: — AIR directs tel: requests to the default telephone dialing app. The URL format must conform to the system conventions under which the app is running. For example, on Android, the URI scheme must be lowercase.

navigateToURL( new URLRequest( &quot;tel:5555555555&quot;) );

*   market: — AIR directs market: requests to the Market app typically supported on Android devices.

navigateToURL( new URLRequest( &quot;market://search?q=Adobe Flash&quot;) );

navigateToURL( new URLRequest( &quot;market://search?q=pname:com.adobe.flashplayer&quot;) );

Where allowed by the operating system, applications can define and register custom URI schemes. You can create a URL using the scheme to launch the application from AIR.
