# Writing callback methods for metadata and cue points {#writing-callback-methods-for-metadata-and-cue-points}

You can trigger actions in your application when specific metadata is received by the player or when specific cue points are reached. When these events occur, you must use specific callback methods as event handlers. The NetStream class specifies the following metadata events that can occur during playback: onCuePoint (FLV files only), onImageData, onMetaData, onPlayStatus, onTextData, and onXMPData.

You must write callback methods for these handlers, or the Flash runtime may throw errors. For example, the following code plays an FLV file named video.flv in the same folder where the project resides:

var nc:NetConnection = new NetConnection(); nc.connect(null);

var ns:NetStream = new NetStream(nc); ns.addEventListener(AsyncErrorEvent.ASYNC_ERROR, asyncErrorHandler); ns.play(&quot;video.flv&quot;);

function asyncErrorHandler(event:AsyncErrorEvent):void

{

trace(event.text);

}

var vid:Video = new Video(); vid.attachNetStream(ns); addChild(vid);

The previous code loads a local video file named video.flv and listens for the asyncError (AsyncErrorEvent.ASYNC_ERROR) to be dispatched. This event is dispatched when an exception is thrown from native asynchronous code. In this case, it is dispatched when the video file contains metadata or cue point information, and the appropriate listeners have not been defined. The previous code handles the asyncError event and ignores the error if you are not interested in the video file’s metadata or cue point information. If you had an FLV with metadata and several cue points, the trace() function would display the following error messages:

Error #2095: openfl.net.NetStream was unable to invoke callback onMetaData. Error #2095: openfl.net.NetStream was unable to invoke callback onCuePoint. Error #2095: openfl.net.NetStream was unable to invoke callback onCuePoint. Error #2095: openfl.net.NetStream was unable to invoke callback onCuePoint.

The errors occur because the NetStream object was unable to find an onMetaData or onCuePoint callback method. There are several ways to define these callback methods within your applications.

**Set the NetStream object’s client property to an Object**

By setting the client property to either an Object or a subclass of NetStream, you can reroute the onMetaData and onCuePoint callback methods or ignore them completely. The following example demonstrates how you can use an empty Object to ignore the callback methods without listening for the asyncError event:

var nc:NetConnection = new NetConnection(); nc.connect(null);

var customClient:Object = new Object();

var ns:NetStream = new NetStream(nc); ns.client = customClient; ns.play(&quot;video.flv&quot;);

var vid:Video = new Video(); vid.attachNetStream(ns); addChild(vid);

If you wanted to listen for either the onMetaData or onCuePoint callback methods, you would need to define methods to handle those callback methods, as shown in the following snippet:

var customClient:Object = new Object(); customClient.onMetaData = metaDataHandler; function metaDataHandler(infoObject:Object):void

{

trace(&quot;metadata&quot;);

}

The previous code listens for the onMetaData callback method and calls the metaDataHandler() method, which traces a string. If the Flash runtime encountered a cue point, no errors would be generated even though no onCuePoint callback method is defined.

## Create a custom class and define methods to handle the callback methods {#create-a-custom-class-and-define-methods-to-handle-the-callback-methods}

The following code sets the NetStream object’s client property to a custom class, CustomClient, which defines handlers for the callback methods:

var nc:NetConnection = new NetConnection(); nc.connect(null);

var ns:NetStream = new NetStream(nc); ns.client = new CustomClient(); ns.play(&quot;video.flv&quot;);

var vid:Video = new Video(); vid.attachNetStream(ns); addChild(vid);

The CustomClient class is as follows:

package

{

public class CustomClient

{

public function onMetaData(infoObject:Object):void

{

trace(&quot;metadata&quot;);

}

}

}

The CustomClient class defines a handler for the onMetaData callback handler. If a cue point was encountered and the onCuePoint callback handler was called, an asyncError event (AsyncErrorEvent.ASYNC_ERROR) would be dispatched saying "flash.net.NetStream was unable to invoke callback onCuePoint." To prevent this error, you would either need to define an onCuePoint callback method in your CustomClient class, or define an event handler for the asyncError event.

## Extend the NetStream class and add methods to handle the callback methods {#extend-the-netstream-class-and-add-methods-to-handle-the-callback-methods}

The following code creates an instance of the CustomNetStream class, which is defined in a later code listing:

var ns:CustomNetStream = new CustomNetStream(); ns.play(&quot;video.flv&quot;);

var vid:Video = new Video(); vid.attachNetStream(ns); addChild(vid);

The following code listing defines the CustomNetStream class that extends the NetStream class, handles the creation of the necessary NetConnection object, and handles the onMetaData and onCuePoint callback handler methods:

package

{

import openfl.net.NetConnection; import openfl.net.NetStream;

public class CustomNetStream extends NetStream

{

private var nc:NetConnection; public function CustomNetStream()

{

nc = new NetConnection(); nc.connect(null); super(nc);

}

public function onMetaData(infoObject:Object):void

{

trace(&quot;metadata&quot;);

}

public function onCuePoint(infoObject:Object):void

{

trace(&quot;cue point&quot;);

}

}

}

If you want to rename the onMetaData() and onCuePoint() methods in the CustomNetStream class, you could use the following code:

package

{

import openfl.net.NetConnection; import openfl.net.NetStream;

public class CustomNetStream extends NetStream

{

private var nc:NetConnection; public var onMetaData:Function; public var onCuePoint:Function; public function CustomNetStream()

{

onMetaData = metaDataHandler; onCuePoint = cuePointHandler; nc = new NetConnection(); nc.connect(null);

super(nc);

}

private function metaDataHandler(infoObject:Object):void

{

trace(&quot;metadata&quot;);

}

private function cuePointHandler(infoObject:Object):void

{

trace(&quot;cue point&quot;);

}

}

}

## Extend the NetStream class and make it dynamic {#extend-the-netstream-class-and-make-it-dynamic}

You can extend the NetStream class and make the subclass dynamic so that onCuePoint and onMetaData callback handlers can be added dynamically. This is demonstrated in the following listing:

var ns:DynamicCustomNetStream = new DynamicCustomNetStream(); ns.play(&quot;video.flv&quot;);

var vid:Video = new Video(); vid.attachNetStream(ns); addChild(vid);

The DynamicCustomNetStream class is as follows:

package

{

import openfl.net.NetConnection; import openfl.net.NetStream;

public dynamic class DynamicCustomNetStream extends NetStream

{

private var nc:NetConnection;

public function DynamicCustomNetStream()

{

nc = new NetConnection(); nc.connect(null); super(nc);

}

}

}

Even with no handlers for the onMetaData and onCuePoint callback handlers, no errors are thrown since the DynamicCustomNetStream class is dynamic. If you want to define methods for the onMetaData and onCuePoint callback handlers, you could use the following code:

var ns:DynamicCustomNetStream = new DynamicCustomNetStream(); ns.onMetaData = metaDataHandler;

ns.onCuePoint = cuePointHandler; [ns.play(&quot;http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/video/cuepoints.flv&quot;);](http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/video/cuepoints.flv)

var vid:Video = new Video(); vid.attachNetStream(ns); addChild(vid);

function metaDataHandler(infoObject:Object):void

{

trace(&quot;metadata&quot;);

}

function cuePointHandler(infoObject:Object):void

{

trace(&quot;cue point&quot;);

}

## Set the NetStream object’s client property to this {#set-the-netstream-object-s-client-property-to-this}

By setting the client property to this, the application looks in the current scope for onMetaData() and

onCuePoint() methods. You can see this in the following example:

var nc:NetConnection = new NetConnection(); nc.connect(null);

var ns:NetStream = new NetStream(nc); ns.client = this; ns.play(&quot;video.flv&quot;);

var vid:Video = new Video(); vid.attachNetStream(ns); addChild(vid);

If the onMetaData or onCuePoint callback handlers are called and no methods exist to handle the callback, no errors are generated. To handle these callback handlers, create an onMetaData() and onCuePoint() method in your code, as seen in the following snippet:

function onMetaData(infoObject:Object):void

{

trace(&quot;metadata&quot;);

}

function onCuePoint(infoObject:Object):void

{

trace(&quot;cue point&quot;);

}
