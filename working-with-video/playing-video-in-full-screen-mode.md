# Playing video in full-screen mode {#playing-video-in-full-screen-mode}

OpenFL allow you to create a full-screen application for your video playback, and support scaling video to full screen.

For AIR content running in full-screen mode on the desktop, the system screen saver and power-saving options are disabled during play until either the video input stops or the user exits full-screen mode.

For full details on using full-screen mode, see

“Working with full-screen mode” on page 167

Enabling full-screen mode for OpenFL in a browser

Before you can implement full-screen mode for OpenFL in a browser, enable it through the Publish template for your application. Templates that allow full screen include &lt;object&gt; and &lt;embed&gt; tags that contain an allowFullScreen parameter. The following example shows the allowFullScreen parameter in an &lt;embed&gt; tag.

&lt;object classid=&quot;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&quot; id=&quot;fullScreen&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;

[codebase=&quot;http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab&quot;&gt;](http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab)

...

&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

&lt;embed src=&quot;fullScreen.swf&quot; allowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot; quality=&quot;high&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#869ca7&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; name=&quot;fullScreen&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot;

play=&quot;true&quot; loop=&quot;false&quot; quality=&quot;high&quot;

allowScriptAccess=&quot;sameDomain&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;

[pluginspage=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer&quot;&gt;](http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer)

&lt;/embed&gt;

...

&lt;/object&gt;

In Flash, select File -&gt; Publish Settings and in the Publish Settings dialog box, on the HTML tab, select the Flash Only

- Allow Full Screen template.

In Flex, ensure that the HTML template includes &lt;object&gt; and &lt;embed&gt; tags that support full screen.

Initiating full-screen mode

For OpenFL content running in a browser, you initiate full-screen mode for video in response to either a mouse click or a keypress. For example, you can initiate full-screen mode when the user clicks a button labeled Full Screen or selects a Full Screen command from a context menu. To respond to the user, add an event listener to the object on which the action occurs. The following code adds an event listener to a button that the user clicks to enter full-screen mode:

var fullScreenButton:Button = new Button(); fullScreenButton.label = &quot;Full Screen&quot;; addChild(fullScreenButton);

fullScreenButton.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, fullScreenButtonHandler);

function fullScreenButtonHandler(event:MouseEvent)

{

stage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN;

}

The code initiates full-screen mode by setting the Stage.displayState property to StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN. This code scales the entire stage to full screen with the video scaling in proportion to the space it occupies on the stage.

The fullScreenSourceRect property allows you to specify a particular area of the stage to scale to full screen. First, define the rectangle that you want to scale to full screen. Then assign it to the Stage.fullScreenSourceRect property. This version of the fullScreenButtonHandler() function adds two additional lines of code that scale just the video to full screen.

private function fullScreenButtonHandler(event:MouseEvent)

{

var screenRectangle:Rectangle = new Rectangle(video.x, video.y, video.width, video.height); stage.fullScreenSourceRect = screenRectangle;

stage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN;

}

Though this example invokes an event handler in response to a mouse click, the technique of going to full-screen mode is the same for both OpenFL. Define the rectangle that you want to scale and then set the Stage.displayState property. For more information, see the [OpenFL API Reference](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/display/Stage.html#displayState).

The complete example, which follows, adds code that creates the connection and the NetStream object for the video and begins to play it.

package

{

import openfl.net.NetConnection; import openfl.net.NetStream; import openfl.media.Video;

import openfl.display.StageDisplayState; import fl.controls.Button;

import openfl.display.Sprite; import openfl.events.MouseEvent;

import openfl.events.FullScreenEvent; import openfl.geom.Rectangle;

public class FullScreenVideoExample extends Sprite

{

var fullScreenButton:Button = new Button(); var video:Video = new Video();

public function FullScreenVideoExample()

{

var videoConnection:NetConnection = new NetConnection(); videoConnection.connect(null);

var videoStream:NetStream = new NetStream(videoConnection); videoStream.client = this;

addChild(video); video.attachNetStream(videoStream);

[videoStream.play(&quot;http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/video/water.flv&quot;);](http://www.helpexamples.com/flash/video/water.flv) fullScreenButton.x = 100;

fullScreenButton.y = 270; fullScreenButton.label = &quot;Full Screen&quot;; addChild(fullScreenButton);

fullScreenButton.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, fullScreenButtonHandler);

}

private function fullScreenButtonHandler(event:MouseEvent)

{

var screenRectangle:Rectangle = new Rectangle(video.x, video.y, video.width, video.height);

stage.fullScreenSourceRect = screenRectangle; stage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN;

}

public function onMetaData(infoObject:Object):void

{

// stub for callback function

}

}

}

The onMetaData() function is a callback function for handling video metadata, if any exists. A callback function is a function that the runtime calls in response to some type of occurrence or event. In this example, the onMetaData()function is a stub that satisfies the requirement to provide the function. For more information, see

“Writing callback methods for metadata and cue points” on page 487

Leaving full-screen mode

A user can leave full-screen mode by entering one of the keyboard shortcuts, such as the Escape key. You can end full- screen mode in Haxe by setting the Stage.displayState property to StageDisplayState.NORMAL. The code in the following example ends full-screen mode when the NetStream.Play.Stop netStatus event occurs.

videoStream.addEventListener(NetStatusEvent.NET_STATUS, netStatusHandler);

private function netStatusHandler(event:NetStatusEvent)

{

if(event.info.code == &quot;NetStream.Play.Stop&quot;) stage.displayState = StageDisplayState.NORMAL;

}

Full-screen hardware acceleration

When you rescale a rectangular area of the stage to full-screen mode, OpenFL uses hardware acceleration, if it&#039;s available and enabled. The runtime uses the video adapter on the computer to speed up scaling of the video, or a portion of the stage, to full-screen size. Under these circumstances, OpenFL applications can often profit by switching to the StageVideo class from the Video class (or Camera class; OpenFL 11.4/AIR 3.4 and higher).
