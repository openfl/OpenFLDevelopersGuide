# Streaming video files {#streaming-video-files}

To stream files from Flash Media Server, you can use the NetConnection and NetStream classes to connect to a remote server instance and play a specified stream. To specify a Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) server, you pass the desired RTMP URL, such as "rtmp://localhost/appName/appInstance", to the NetConnection.connect() method instead of passing null. To play a specific live or recorded stream from the specified Flash Media Server, you pass an identifying name for live data published by NetStream.publish(), or a recorded filename for playback to the NetStream.play() method.

If you want to build more complex applications involving video or camera objects, Flash Media Server offers a combination of streaming media capabilities and a development environment for creating and delivering media applications to a wide audience. This combination enables developers to create applications such as Video on Demand, live web-event broadcasts, and Mp3 streaming as well as video blogging, video messaging, and multimedia chat environments.
