# Sound example: Podcast Player {#sound-example-podcast-player}

A podcast is a sound file that is distributed over the Internet, on demand or by subscription. Podcasts are usually published as part of a series, which is also called a podcast channel. Because podcast episodes can last anywhere from one minute to many hours, they are usually streamed while playing. Podcast episodes, which are also called items, are usually delivered in the mp3 file format. Video podcasts are also popular, but this sample application plays only audio podcasts that use mp3 files.

This example is not a full-featured podcast aggregator application. For example, it does not manage subscriptions to specific podcasts or remember which podcasts the user has listened to the next time the application is run. It could serve as a starting point for a more full-featured podcast aggregator.

The Podcast Player example illustrates the following Haxe programming techniques:

• Reading an external RSS feed and parsing its XML content

• Creating a SoundFacade class to simplify loading and playback of sound files

• Displaying sound playback progress

• Pausing and resuming sound playback

**Reading RSS data for a podcast channel**

The Podcast Player application starts by reading information about a number of podcast channels and their episodes:

*   1.  First, the application reads an XML configuration file that contains a list of podcast channels and displays the list of channels to the user.
    2.  When the user selects one of the podcast channels, it reads the RSS feed for the channel and displays a list of the channel episodes.

This example uses the URLLoader utility class to retrieve text-based data from a remote location or a local file. The Podcast Player first creates a URLLoader object to get a list of RSS feeds in XML format from the playerconfig.xml file. Next, when the user selects a specific feed from the list, a new URLLoader object is created to read the RSS data from that feed’s URL.

## Simplifying sound loading and playback using the SoundFacade class {#simplifying-sound-loading-and-playback-using-the-soundfacade-class}

The Haxe sound architecture is powerful but complex. Applications that only need basic sound loading and playback features can use a class that hides some of the complexity by providing a simpler set of method calls and events. In the world of software design patterns, such a class is called a _facade_.

The SoundFacade class presents a single interface for performing the following tasks:

• Loading sound files using a Sound object, a SoundLoaderContext object, and the SoundMixer class

• Playing sound files using the Sound object and the SoundChannel object

• Dispatching playback progress events

• Pausing and resuming playback of the sound using the Sound object and the SoundChannel object

The SoundFacade class tries to offer most of the functionality of the Haxe sound classes with less complexity. The following code shows the class declaration, the class properties, and the SoundFacade() constructor method:

public class SoundFacade extends EventDispatcher

{

public var s:Sound;

public var sc:SoundChannel;
public var url:String;

public var bufferTime:int = 1000;

public var isLoaded:Boolean = false;
public var isReadyToPlay:Boolean = false;
public var isPlaying:Boolean = false;
public var isStreaming:Boolean = true;
public var autoLoad:Boolean = true;
public var autoPlay:Boolean = true;

public var pausePosition:int = 0;

public static const PLAY_PROGRESS:String = "playProgress";
public var progressInterval:int = 1000;

public var playTimer:Timer;

public function SoundFacade(soundUrl:String, autoLoad:Boolean = true,
autoPlay:Boolean = true, streaming:Boolean = true, bufferTime:int = -1):void

{

this.url = soundUrl;

// Sets Boolean values that determine the behavior of this object this.autoLoad = autoLoad;

this.autoPlay = autoPlay; this.isStreaming = streaming;

// Defaults to the global bufferTime value if (bufferTime &lt; 0)

{

bufferTime = SoundMixer.bufferTime;

}

// Keeps buffer time reasonable, between 0 and 30 seconds this.bufferTime = Math.min(Math.max(0, bufferTime), 30000);

if (autoLoad)

{

load();

}

}

The SoundFacade class extends the EventDispatcher class so that it can dispatch its own events. The class code first declares properties for a Sound object and a SoundChannel object. The class also stores the value of the URL of the sound file and a bufferTime property to use when streaming the sound. In addition, it accepts some Boolean parameter values that affect the loading and playback behavior:

• The autoLoad parameter tells the object that sound loading should start as soon as this object is created.

• The autoPlay parameter indicates that sound playing should start as soon as enough sound data has been loaded. If this is a streaming sound, playback will begin as soon as enough data, as specified by the bufferTime property, has loaded.

• The streaming parameter indicates that this sound file can start playing before loading has completed.

The bufferTime parameter defaults to a value of -1\. If the constructor method detects a negative value in the bufferTime parameter, it sets the bufferTime property to the value of SoundMixer.bufferTime. This lets the application default to the global SoundMixer.bufferTime value as desired.

If the autoLoad parameter is set to true, the constructor method immediately calls the following load() method to start loading the sound file:

public function load():void

{

if (this.isPlaying)

{

this.stop();

this.s.close();

}

this.isLoaded = false; this.s = new Sound();

this.s.addEventListener(ProgressEvent.PROGRESS, onLoadProgress); this.s.addEventListener(Event.OPEN, onLoadOpen); this.s.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onLoadComplete); this.s.addEventListener(Event.ID3, onID3); this.s.addEventListener(IOErrorEvent.IO_ERROR, onIOError); this.s.addEventListener(SecurityErrorEvent.SECURITY_ERROR, onIOError);

var req:URLRequest = new URLRequest(this.url);

var context:SoundLoaderContext = new SoundLoaderContext(this.bufferTime, true); this.s.load(req, context);

}

The load() method creates a new Sound object and then adds listeners for all of the important sound events. Then it tells the Sound object to load the sound file, using a SoundLoaderContext object to pass in the bufferTime value.

Because the url property can be changed, a SoundFacade instance can be used to play different sound files in succession: simply change the url property and call the load() method, and the new sound file will be loaded.

The following three event listener methods show how the SoundFacade object tracks loading progress and decides when to start playing the sound:

public function onLoadOpen(event:Event):void

{

if (this.isStreaming)

{

this.isReadyToPlay = true; if (autoPlay)

{

this.play();

}

}

this.dispatchEvent(event.clone());

}

public function onLoadProgress(event:ProgressEvent):void

{

this.dispatchEvent(event.clone());

}

public function onLoadComplete(event:Event):void

{

this.isReadyToPlay = true; this.isLoaded = true; this.dispatchEvent(evt.clone());

if (autoPlay &amp;&amp; !isPlaying)

{

play();

}

}

The onLoadOpen() method executes when sound loading starts. If the sound can be played in streaming mode, the onLoadComplete() method sets the isReadyToPlay flag to true right away. The isReadyToPlay flag determines whether the application can start the sound playing, perhaps in response to a user action like clicking a Play button. The SoundChannel class manages the buffering of sound data, so there is no need to explicitly check whether enough data has been loaded before calling the play() method.

The onLoadProgress() method executes periodically during the loading process. It simply dispatches a clone of its ProgressEvent object for use by code that uses this SoundFacade object.

When the sound data has been fully loaded the onLoadComplete() method executes, calling the play() method for non-streaming sounds if needed. The play() method itself is shown below.

public function play(pos:int = 0):void

{

if (!this.isPlaying)

{

if (this.isReadyToPlay)

{

this.sc = this.s.play(pos); this.sc.addEventListener(Event.SOUND_COMPLETE, onPlayComplete); this.isPlaying = true;

this.playTimer = new Timer(this.progressInterval); this.playTimer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, onPlayTimer); this.playTimer.start();

}

}

}

The play() method calls the Sound.play() method if the sound is ready to play. The resulting SoundChannel object is stored in the sc property. The play() method then creates a Timer object that will be used to dispatch playback progress events at regular intervals.

## Displaying playback progress {#displaying-playback-progress}

Creating a Timer object to drive playback monitoring is complex operation that you should only have to code once. Encapsulating this Timer logic in a reusable class like the SoundFacade class lets applications listen to the same kinds of progress events when a sound is loading and when it is playing.

The Timer object that is created by the SoundFacade.play() method dispatches a TimerEvent instance every second. The following onPlayTimer() method executes whenever a new TimerEvent arrives:

public function onPlayTimer(event:TimerEvent):void

{

var estimatedLength:int =

Math.ceil(this.s.length / (this.s.bytesLoaded / this.s.bytesTotal)); var progEvent:ProgressEvent =

new ProgressEvent(PLAY_PROGRESS, false, false, this.sc.position, estimatedLength); this.dispatchEvent(progEvent);

}

The onPlayTimer() method implements the size estimation technique described in the section

"Monitoring

playback" on page 451

. Then it creates a new ProgressEvent instance with an event type of SoundFacade.PLAY_PROGRESS, with the bytesLoaded property set to the current position of the SoundChannel object and the bytesTotal property set to the estimated length of the sound data.

## Pausing and resuming playback {#pausing-and-resuming-playback}

The SoundFacade.play() method shown previously accepts a pos parameter corresponding to a starting position in the sound data. If the pos value is zero, the sound starts playing from the beginning.

The SoundFacade.stop() method also accepts a pos parameter as shown here:

public function stop(pos:int = 0):void

{

if (this.isPlaying)

{

this.pausePosition = pos; this.sc.stop(); this.playTimer.stop(); this.isPlaying = false;

}

}

Whenever the SoundFacade.stop() method is called, it sets the pausePosition property so that the application knows where to position the playhead if the user wants to resume playback of the same sound.

The SoundFacade.pause() and SoundFacade.resume() methods shown below invoke the SoundFacade.stop()

and SoundFacade.play() methods respectively, passing a pos parameter value each time.

public function pause():void

{

stop(this.sc.position);

}

public function resume():void

{

play(this.pausePosition);

}

The pause() method passes the current SoundChannel.position value to the play() method, which stores that value in the pausePosition property. The resume() method starts playing the same sound again using the pausePosition value as the starting point.

## Extending the Podcast Player example {#extending-the-podcast-player-example}

This example presents a bare-bones Podcast Player that showcases the use of the reusable SoundFacade class. You could add other features to enhance the usefulness of this application, including the following:

• Store the list of feeds and usage information about each episode in a SharedObject instance that can be used the next time the user runs the application.

• Let the user add his or her own RSS feeds to the list of podcast channels.

• Remember the position of the playhead when the user stops or leaves an episode, so it can be restarted from that point next time the user runs the application.

• Download mp3 files of episodes for listening offline, when the user is not connected to the Internet.

• Add subscription features that periodically check for new episodes in a podcast channel and update the episode list automatically.

• Add podcast searching and browsing functionality using an API from a podcast hosting service like Odeo.com.
