# Chapter 24: Working with sound {#chapter-24-working-with-sound}

OpenFL is made for immersive, interactive applicationsâ€”and one often overlooked
element of powerfully immersive applications is sound. You can add sound effects
to a video game, audio feedback to an application user interface, or even make a
program that analyzes mp3 files loaded over the Internet, with sound at the core
of the application.

You can load external audio files and work with audio that's embedded as assets.
