# Touch support discovery {#touch-support-discovery}

OpenFL 10.1 and later, Adobe AIR 2 and later

Use the [Multitouch class](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/ui/Multitouch.html) properties to set the scope of touch input your application handles. Then, test the environment to ensure that support exists for the events your Haxe handles. Specifically, first establish the type of touch input for your application. The options are: touch point, gesture, or none (interpret all touch input as mouse clicks and use mouse event handlers, only). Then, use the properties and methods of the Multitouch class to make sure that the runtime is in an environment that supports the touch input your application requires. Test the runtime environment for support of the types of touch input (such as whether it can interpret gestures), and respond accordingly.

**_Note:_** _The Multitouch class properties are static properties, and do not belong to instances of any class. Use them with the syntax Multitouch.property, for example:_

var touchSupport:Boolean = Multitouch.supportsTouchEvents;

**Set the input type**

The Flash runtime must know the type of touch input to interpret, because a touch event can have many elements or phases. If a finger simply touches a touch-enabled screen, does the runtime dispatch a touch event? Or does it wait for a gesture? Or does the runtime track the touch as a mouse-down event? An application that supports touch input must establish the type of touch events it handles for the Flash runtime. Use the Multitouch.inputMode property to establish the type of touch input for the runtime. The input mode can be one of three options:

**None** No special handling is provided for touch events. Set: Multitouch.inputMode=MultitouchInputMode.NONE

and use the MouseEvent class to handle input.

**Single touch points** All touch input is interpreted, individually, and all touch points can be tracked and handled. Set:

Multitouch.inputMode=MultitouchInputMode.TOUCH_POINT and use the TouchEvent class to handle input.

**Gesture input** The device or operating system interprets input as a complex form of finger movement across the screen. The device or operating system collectively assigns the movement to a single gesture input event. Set: Multitouch.inputMode=MultitouchInputMode.GESTURE and use the TransformGestureEvent, PressAndTapGestureEvent, or GestureEvent classes to handle input.

See

"Touch event handling" on page 585

for an example that uses the Multitouch.inputMode property to set the input type before handling a touch event.

## Test for touch input support {#test-for-touch-input-support}

Other properties of the Multitouch class provide values for fine-tuning your application to the current environmentâ€™s touch support. The Flash runtime populates values for the number of simultaneous touch points allowed or gestures available. If the runtime is in an environment that does not support the touch event handling your application needs, provide the user with an alternative. For example, provide mouse event handling or information about what features are available, or not, in the current environment.
