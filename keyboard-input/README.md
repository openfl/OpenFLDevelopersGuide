# Chapter 30: Keyboard input {#chapter-30-keyboard-input}

Your application can capture and respond to keyboard input. Note that this
section assumes that you are already familiar with the ActionScript 3.0 event
model. For more information, see
[Handling events](../handling-events/README.md).

<!-- TODO: uncomment if IME is implemented
and can manipulate an IME to let users type non-ASCII text characters in multibyte languages.-->

<!-- TODO: uncomment if these capabilities are implemented
For information on discovering what kind of keyboard support is available (such
as physical, virtual, alphanumeric, or 12-button numeric) during runtime, see
[Discovering input types](../basics-of-user-interaction.md#discovering-input-types).-->

<!-- TODO: uncomment if IME is implemented
An Input Method Editor (IME) allows users to type complex characters and symbols
using a standard keyboard. You can use the IME classes to enable users to take
advantage of their system IME in your applications.-->
