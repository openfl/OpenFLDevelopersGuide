# Encrypted local storage {#encrypted-local-storage}

The [EncryptedLocalStore](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/data/EncryptedLocalStore.html) class (ELS) provides an encrypted local storage mechanism that you can be use as a small cache for an application's private data. ELS data cannot be shared between applications. The intent of ELS is to allow an application to store easily recreated items such as login credentials and other private information. ELS data should not be considered as permanent, as outlined in "Limitations of the encrypted local store" and "Best practices," below.

**_Note:_** _In addition to the encrypted local store, AIR also provides encryption for content stored in SQL databases. For details, see_

_"Using encryption with SQL databases" on page 758_

_._

You may want to use the encrypted local store to cache information that must be secured, such as login credentials for web services. The ELS is appropriate for storing information that must be kept private from other users. It does not, however, protect the data from other processes run under the same user account. It is thus not appropriate for protecting secret application data, such as DRM or encryption keys.

On desktop platforms, AIR uses DPAPI on Windows, KeyChain on Mac OS and iOS, and KeyRing or KWallet on Linux to associate the encrypted local store to each application and user. The encrypted local store uses AES-CBC 128- bit encryption.

On Android, the data stored by the EncryptedLocalStorage class are not encrypted. Instead the data is protected by the user-level security provided by the operating system. The Android operating system assigns every application a separate user ID. Applications can only access their own files and files created in public locations (such as the removable storage card). Note that on "rooted" Android devices, applications running with root privileges CAN access the files of other applications. Thus on a rooted device, the encrypted local store does not provide as high a level of data protection as it does on on a non-rooted device.

Information in the encrypted local store is only available to AIR application content in the application security sandbox.

If you update an AIR application, the updated version retains access to any existing data in the encrypted local store unless:

*   The items were added with the stronglyBound parameter set to true
*   The existing and update versions are both published prior to AIR 1.5.3 and the update is signed with a migration signature.

Limitations of the encrypted local store

The data in the encrypted local store is protected by the user’s operating system account credentials. Other entities cannot access the data in the store unless they can login as that user. However, the data is not secure against access by other applications run by an authenticated user.

Because the user must be authenticated for these attacks to work, the user’s private data is still protected (unless the user account itself is compromised). However, data that your application may want to keep secret from users, such as keys used for licensing or digital rights management, is not secure. Thus the ELS is not an appropriate location for storing such information. It is only an appropriate place for storing a user’s private data, such as passwords.

Data in the ELS can be lost for a variety of reasons. For example, the user could uninstall the application and delete the encrypted file. Or, the publisher ID could be changed as a result of an update. Thus the ELS should be treated as a private cache, not a permanent data storage.

The stronglyBound parameter is deprecated and should not be set to true. Setting the parameter to true does not provide any additional protection for data. At the same time, access to the data is lost whenever the application is updated — even if the publisher ID stays the same.

The encrypted local store may perform more slowly if the stored data exceeds 10MB.

When you uninstall an AIR application, the uninstaller does not delete data stored in the encrypted local store.

Best practices

The best practices for using the ELS include:

*   Use the ELS to store sensitive user data such as passwords (setting stronglyBound to false)
*   Do not use the ELS to store applications secrets such as DRM keys or licensing tokens.
*   Provide a way for your application to recreate the data stored in the ELS if the ELS data is lost. For example, by prompting the user to re-enter their account credentials when necessary.
*   Do not use the stronglyBound parameter.
*   If you do set stronglyBound to true, do not migrate stored items during an update. Recreate the data after the update instead.
*   Only store relatively small amounts of data. For larger amounts of data, use an AIR SQL database with encryption.

**Adding data to the encrypted local store**

Use the setItem() static method of the EncryptedLocalStore class to store data in the local store. The data is stored in a hash table, using strings as keys, with the data stored as byte arrays.

For example, the following code stores a string in the encrypted local store:

var str:String = "Bob";

var bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray(); bytes.writeUTFBytes(str); EncryptedLocalStore.setItem("firstName", bytes);

The third parameter of the setItem() method, the stronglyBound parameter, is optional. When this parameter is set to true, the encrypted local store binds the stored item to the storing AIR application’s digital signature and bits:

var str:String = "Bob";

var bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray(); bytes.writeUTFBytes(str); EncryptedLocalStore.setItem("firstName", bytes, false);

For an item that is stored with stronglyBound set to true, subsequent calls to getItem() only succeed if the calling AIR application is identical to the storing application (if no data in files in the application directory have changed). If the calling AIR application is different from the storing application, the application throws an Error exception when you call getItem() for a strongly bound item. If you update your application, it will not be able to read strongly bound data previously written to the encrypted local store. Setting stronglyBound to true on mobile devices is ignored; the parameter is always treated as false.

If the stronglyBound parameter is set to false (the default), only the publisher ID needs to stay the same for the application to read the data. The bits of the application may change (and they need to be signed by the same publisher), but they do not need to be the exact same bits as were in application that stored the data. Updated applications with the same publisher ID as the original can continue to access the data.

**_Note:_** _In practice, setting stronglyBound to true does not add any additional data protection. A "malicious" user could still alter an application to gain access to items stored in the ELS. Furthermore, data is protected from external, non-user threats just as strongly whether stronglyBound is set to true or false. For these reasons, setting stronglyBound to true is discouraged._

## Accessing data in the encrypted local store {#accessing-data-in-the-encrypted-local-store}

Adobe AIR 1.0 and later

You can retrieve a value from the encrypted local store by using the EncryptedLocalStore.getItem() method, as in the following example:

var storedValue:ByteArray = EncryptedLocalStore.getItem("firstName"); trace(storedValue.readUTFBytes(storedValue.length)); // "Bob"

## Removing data from the encrypted local store {#removing-data-from-the-encrypted-local-store}

Adobe AIR 1.0 and later

You can delete a value from the encrypted local store by using the EncryptedLocalStore.removeItem() method, as in the following example:

EncryptedLocalStore.removeItem("firstName");

You can clear all data from the encrypted local store by calling the EncryptedLocalStore.reset() method, as in the following example:

EncryptedLocalStore.reset();
