# Getting file system information

The File class includes the following static properties that provide some useful
information about the file system:

| Property          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `File.lineEnding` | The line-ending character sequence used by the host operating system. On Mac OS and Linux, this is the line-feed character. On Windows, this is the carriage return character followed by the line-feed character. |
| `File.separator`  | The host operating system's path component separator character. On Mac OS and Linux, this is the forward slash (/) character. On Windows, it is the backslash (\\ character.                                       |

<!-- TODO: uncomment when systemCharset is implemented in OpenFL
| `File.systemCharset` | The default encoding used for files by the host operating system. This pertains to the character set used by the operating system, corresponding to its language.                                                  |
-->

The `Capabilities` class also includes useful system information that can be
useful when working with files:

| Property              | Description                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Capabilities.language | Specifies the language code of the system on which the player is running. |
| Capabilities.os       | Specifies the current operating system.                                   |

Note: Be careful when using `Capabilities.os` to determine system
characteristics. If a more specific property exists to determine a system
characteristic, use it. Otherwise, you run the risk of writing code that does
not work correctly on all platforms. For example, consider the following code:

```haxe
var separator:String;
if (Capablities.os.indexOf("Mac") > -1)
{
    separator = "/";
}
else
{
    separator = "\\";
}
```

This code leads to problems on Linux. It is better to simply use the
`File.separator` property.
