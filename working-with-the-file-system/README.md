# Chapter 38: Working with the file system {#chapter-38-working-with-the-file-system}

OpenFL running in a web browser provides basic file reading and writing
capabilities, via
[the FileReference class](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/net/FileReference.html).
For security reasons, when running in a web browser, the user must always grant
permission before you can read or write a file.

OpenFL on native platforms provides more complete access to the file system of
the host computer than is available on the web. Using the OpenFL file system
API, you can access and manage directories and files, create directories and
files, write data to files, and so on.
