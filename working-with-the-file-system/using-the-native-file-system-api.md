# Using the native file system API

The OpenFL native file system API includes the following classes:

- [File](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/filesystem/File.html)

- [FileMode](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/filesystem/FileMode.html)

- [FileStream](https://api.openfl.org/openfl/filesystem/FileStream.html)

The file system API lets you do the following (and more):

- Copy, create, delete, and move files and directories

- Get information about files and directories

- Read and write files
